This Project is called Foodie Web.
It is a web application that allows users to browse through and search millions of food recipes.
It also allows users to find recipes and ideas on what to cook based on ingredients they enter.
Users can also create an account and login into foodie web.
Foodie Web was created with Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and SQL.
Foodie web was created as a final project to fulfill the requirements of Harvard's CS50 (Intro to Computer Science) course.
